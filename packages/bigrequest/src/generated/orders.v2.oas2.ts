     * **Usage notes**
     *
     * There are three methods for generating a tracking link for a shipment:
     *
     * 1. Use `shipping_provider` and `tracking_number`: This generates an automatic tracking link that you can click from the BigCommerce control panel and customer-facing emails. The `generated_tracking_link` property in the API response represents this tracking link. The `tracking_link` property in the API response will remain empty.
     *
     * 2. Use `tracking_carrier` and `tracking_number`: This also creates an automatic tracking link that you can click in both the BigCommerce control panel and customer-facing emails. Like the previous method, the `generated_tracking_link` property in the API response represents this tracking link. The `tracking_link` property in the API response will remain empty.
     *
     * 3. Supply a custom `tracking_link`: By providing a value for the `tracking_link` property, you can use your own tracking link within the BigCommerce control panel and in customer-facing emails. The API response will return your supplied tracking link as part of the `tracking_link` property in the response. In situations when there isn't a `generated_tracking_link`, the property in the API response will remain empty.
     *
     * Acceptable values for `shipping_provider` include an empty string (`""`), `auspost`, `carrier_{your_carrier_id}` (only used if the carrier is a [third-party Shipping Provider](/docs/integrations/shipping)), `canadapost`, `endicia`, `usps`, `fedex`, `royalmail`, `ups`, `upsready`, `upsonline`, or `shipperhq`.
     *
     * Acceptable values for `tracking_carrier` include an empty string (`""`) or one of the valid [tracking-carrier values](https://github.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/blob/master/assets/csv/tracking_carrier_values.csv).

   * Create Order Shipment

   *
   * **Required Fields**
   * *   order_address_id
   * *   items
   *
   * **Usage notes**
   *
   * There are three methods for generating a tracking link for a shipment:
   *
   * 1. Use `shipping_provider` and `tracking_number`: This generates an automatic tracking link that you can click from the BigCommerce control panel and customer-facing emails. The `generated_tracking_link` property in the API response represents this tracking link. The `tracking_link` property in the API response will remain empty.
   *
   * 2. Use `tracking_carrier` and `tracking_number`: This also creates an automatic tracking link that you can click in both the BigCommerce control panel and customer-facing emails. Like the previous method, the `generated_tracking_link` property in the API response represents this tracking link. The `tracking_link` property in the API response will remain empty.
   *
   * 3. Supply a custom `tracking_link`: By providing a value for the `tracking_link` property, you can use your own tracking link within the BigCommerce control panel and in customer-facing emails. The API response will return your supplied tracking link as part of the `tracking_link` property in the response. In situations when there isn't a `generated_tracking_link`, the property in the API response will remain empty.
   *
   * Acceptable values for `shipping_provider` include an empty string (`""`), `auspost`, `carrier_{your_carrier_id}` (only used if the carrier is a [third-party Shipping Provider](/docs/integrations/shipping)), `canadapost`, `endicia`, `usps`, `fedex`, `royalmail`, `ups`, `upsready`, `upsonline`, or `shipperhq`.
   *
   * Acceptable values for `tracking_carrier` include an empty string (`""`) or one of the valid [tracking-carrier values](https://github.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/blob/master/assets/csv/tracking_carrier_values.csv).
